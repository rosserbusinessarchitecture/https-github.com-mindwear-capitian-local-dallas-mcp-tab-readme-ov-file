/**
 * Tool tiers.
 *
 * `core` is the minimum set most people need from this MCP. Useful once your
 * server grows past ~20 tools -- some MCP clients render the tools/list
 * payload to the LLM and degrade quality past a soft cap (roughly 20-25).
 *
 * Set DALLAS_CIVIC_MCP_TIER=core in the client config to load
 * only this set. Default (unset or "all") loads everything.
 *
 * Empty by default -- this file only matters once you're adding tools past
 * the point where a full tools/list becomes unwieldy. Add public tool names
 * here as your server grows. Names here are the PUBLIC (post-rename, if you
 * use one) names registered with the server.
